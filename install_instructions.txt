Installing with a zip file

The setup for Linux integration with the Amazon Q Developer CLI requires installing the appropriate file for your system, verifying the file, and installing the program.
Install and update requirements

    You must be able to extract or "unzip" the downloaded package. If your operating system doesn't have the built-in unzip command, use an equivalent.

    Amazon Q for command line requires glibc 2.34 or newer, which is included by default in most major Linux distributions released since 2021.

    For older distributions with glibc versions earlier than 2.34, use the special musl-based version (indicated by -musl.zip in the filename).

    Amazon Q for command line is supported on 64-bit x86_64 and ARM aarch64 versions of recent distributions of Fedora, Ubuntu, and Amazon Linux 2023.

Checking your glibc version

To determine which version you need, check your glibc version:

ldd --version

If the version is 2.34 or newer, use the standard version. If it's older, use the musl version.
To download the installation file

Choose the appropriate download command based on your system architecture and glibc version:
Standard version (glibc 2.34+)
Linux x86-64

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf "https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/q-x86_64-linux.zip" -o "q.zip"

Linux ARM (aarch64)

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf "https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/q-aarch64-linux.zip" -o "q.zip"

Musl version (for glibc < 2.34)
Linux x86-64 with musl

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf "https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/q-x86_64-linux-musl.zip" -o "q.zip"

Linux ARM (aarch64) with musl

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf "https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/q-aarch64-linux-musl.zip" -o "q.zip"
